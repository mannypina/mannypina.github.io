							<p><em>“Quantum superpositions radically undo classical notions of identity and being…Quantum superpositions (at least on Bohr’s account) tell us that being/becoming is an indeterminate matter…” ~Karen Barad, “Quantum Entanglements,” p. 251.

							<p><strong>overview</strong></p>
					
							<p>Classic Euclidean geometry holds that two <em>objects</em> cannot simultaneously occupy the same space-time location. This is a relatively intuitive topology that informs the way in which the world is typically experienced, both physically and digitally. For example, my coffee mug may rest <em>on top of</em> my desk, but it cannot occupy the same space as the desk at the same time. Likewise, in conventional computing technology, a binary digit may have a value of either 0 or 1, but not both. And, as previously discussed, this also extends to chronotypes since they are typically understood to  arise from discrete material configurations. But a quantum approach turns conventional thinking on its head and introduces a strange new topology wherein two (or more) objects can, and indeed frequently do, occupy the same space-time locality at once—a core feature of the quantum world known as <em>superposition</em>.</p>
		
							<p>Superposition isn’t a theoretical construct that is as counterintuitive or complex as it might initially seem; afterall, we see evidence of overlap in the oscillations of a medium like water which results in the crests and troughs of waves. A crest is simply the amplification of energy that occurs when two or more waves occupy the same point in space at the same time. All this makes perfect sense when we’re talking about waves, not particles. However, precisely because energy and matter are relational, not oppositional, it is possible for matter, too, to likewise exist in a state of superposition. Ontologies, concomitantly, can be thought of as quantum rather than multiple. Quantum superposition is therefore not only a useful, but also a necessary construct for extending our understanding of chronotypes and how they operate with/in techno-material spaces.</p>
							
							<p>Again, it’s important to note that in turning to a quantum perspective, my intention is not to try to build a mathematical proof, nor am I attempting to construct a physics argument. Instead, I am claiming that quantum superposition is a necessary <em>theoretical framework</em> for explaining a rhetorical phenomenon—namely the simultaneous enactment of many chronotypes in a given techno-material space— that conventional thinking holds to be intractable. In this section, I discuss the results of this research study and show how many chronotypes exist in a state of superposition within various technological learning spaces thereby creating the potential for these technologies to avoid being subsumed under an ethic of expediency. This analysis focuses on the ontological enactments of blackboard <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title=" I avoid capitalizing “blackboard” here in order to indicate that this digital technology is quantum, or single-multiple, “more than one but less than many” (Law, 1999, p. 10).">[1]</a>, as this was the most frequently invoked digital learning technology, but equally applies to other digital learning technologies such as canvas, slack, youtube, microsoft teams, zoom, to name only a few.</p>
					
							<p>A key argument that I draw toward is that the potential to enact digital technologies as a matter of social justice cannot be actualized until instructional and technological energy is directly applied so as to bring social justice into reality. Social justice in digital spaces is thus intra-active and emergent because “quantum superpositions…tell us that being/becoming is an indeterminate matter” (Barad, 2010, p. 251). There is no determinate fact of the matter concerning how these spaces will be enacted, as matters of efficiency or of social justice. Put differently, while superposition does open up the potential for technologies to be enacted in ways beyond that of efficiency, they nevertheless remain in a state of <em>indeterminacy</em> until they are observed as such. What is required, therefore, is for institutions and instructors to actively bring matters of social justice to the forefront of their enactments of digital technologies. Failure to do so necessitates that they will remain in a state of indeterminacy and thus increases the potential for them to [continue to] give way to models of efficiency given, again, Katz’s (1992) assertion that an ethic of expediency tends to obscure even the possibility of alternative enactments of digital technologies. More succinctly, institutional structures (including faculty) tend to enact digital learning technologies first as a matter of efficiency, as I show below. Absent directed and intentional enactments beyond that of efficiency necessitates that this will continue to be the dominant valuation and enactment of digital technologies.</p>
