							<p><strong>re/turning to chronotypes</strong></p>
					
							<p>Jack (2022) re/turned <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="To re/turn to something is not (necessarily) to go back to an already-established past; instead to re/turn is to “turn it over again and again—iteratively intra-acting, re-diffracting, diffracting anew, in the making of new temporalities” (Barad, “Diffracting” 168).">[1]</a> to chronotypes as a means for examining the relationship between subject matter expertise and water ontologies (See Table 2). This further exploration of chronotypes again drew on a public policy debate (this time over water rights) but was decidedly less interested in the discursive forms of rhetorical argument possible in a given spacetime configuration. Instead, Jack worked to tie ethos (expressed as expertise) to materiality vis-à-vis the chronotype. She argued clearly that “we can understand these different enactments of water not simply as discursive frames that all represent the same thing but as ontologies arising from diverse enactments of water present in different communities and institutions'' (p. 328, emphasis added). Yes, chronotypes are discursive; but they are also deeply ontological&mdash;entangled with and in matter.</p>
				
							<p>Toward this end, Jack offered three different chronotopic enactments of “water-as”, each with a unique spatiotemporal relationship that authorizes unique types of expertise. The naming of multiple (and, per Jack, competing) ontologies represents a crucial advancement in theorizing the rhetorical import of chronotypes (See Table 2). In Jack’s initial work, again, chronotypes remained largely abstractions, discursive frameworks that dis/allowed certain arguments in relation to a given technology. As a rhetorical actant, therefore, GMFs were relatively stable and singular&mdash;it was the argument itself that took on different spatiotemporal characteristics. Conversely, as an ontology, <em>water itself</em>, not the arguments it authorizes, is an iterative and emergent rhetorical agent. What’s more, similar to the aforementioned concept of times as multiple, water ontologies too emerge as chronotropically multiple: water located in a lab (water-as-chemical-entity) is not the same water that is located in a private well (water-as-resource).</p>

							<caption><b>Table 2</b>: This table presents Jack’s (2022) most recent re-theorization that situates chronotypes as multiple ontologies; important to note is that each chronotype is restricted to discrete material sites—chronotypes do not flow between or within localities. </caption>
							
							<br>
							<br>
					
							<p>Importantly, for Jack, chronotypes are indeed multiple and simultaneous, but they arise from discrete space-time configurings <a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="This reasoning closely follows Annemarie Mol’s (2002) understanding of atherosclerosis as being distributed across discrete sites of becoming. For Mol, each enactment of the disease has “a site of its own” (p. 115).">[2]</a>. For example, the water-as-lifeblood ontology could not result from a space-time configuring wherein water is located in a lab. According to multiple ontologies, it is the limited space-time of the laboratory itself that allows water to be enacted as water-as-chemical-entity; conversely it is the deep time scale and a broad ecosystem that enables the performance of water-as-lifeblood. And as multiple, these two ontologies could not occupy the same topological space and therefore necessarily exist, at least partially, in contradistinction to one another. This is not to say, however, that these ontologies are wholly separate; they are not. As Annemarie Mol (1999) has argued, “what ‘multiplicity’ entails instead is that, while realities may clash at some points, elsewhere the various performances of an object may <em>collaborate</em> and even <em>depend on</em> one another” (p. 83). It might therefore be more accurate to say that chronotypes can be enacted as a mutually inclusive single-multiple&mdash;as “more than one but less than many” (Law, 1999, p. 10). But despite this hanging-together of chronotopic ontologies, we are still confronted with the problem that multiple enactments of chronotypes remain separate enough such that they are unable to simultaneously occupy the same space-time locality. The time-space configuring seems to limit and fix what chronotypes may arise from it.</p>
					
							<p><strong>toward the quantum</strong></p>
					
							<p>But in technologically mediated space-times, quite often multiple chronotypes frequently do inhabit the same material configuring&mdash;a contradiction that multiple ontologies seemingly cannot resolve. Learning technologies, like LMSs or Zoom, can simultaneously be enacted as a matter of efficiency <em>and</em> social justice in the same space-time configuration. What I am proposing, therefore, is a model of quantum ontologies that builds on Jack’s theorization of chronotypes and is better able to account for a variety of value-oriented chronotopic enactments existing within the same material configuring. Whereas Annemarie Mol (2002) argued for flow <em>between</em> sites of becoming, I posit the existence of flow <em>within</em> a site. Such a re-rendering of chronotypes is important because technological spaces are frequently underwritten by what Stephen Katz (1992) has previously termed an ethic of expediency wherein efficiency-for-efficiency’s sake becomes the driving ethical force, and so “subsume all other ethics under it, making all ethics expedients and thus replacing them” (p. 270). However, even though quantum ontologies create the potential for enactments of digital technology beyond that of efficiency, it is vitally important to note that the realization of such enactments hinges on their ability to be accounted for. What is needed, then, is what Barad (2005) terms a <em>politics of possibilities</em>: “ways of responsibly imagining and intervening in the configurations of power, that is, intra-actively configuring spacetimematter” (p. 246).</p>
