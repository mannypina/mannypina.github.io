							<p><strong>chronotypes</strong></p>
							<p>While I hesitate to assign a singular starting point for theorizing chronotypes, perhaps the most relevant place to begin is with Mikael Bakhtin’s <em>The Dialogic Imagination</em> (1981). For Bakhtin, a chronotype refers to the “intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships expressed in literature” (p. 84). As in Einstein’s theory of special relativity, the chronotype, as it manifests in literature, fuses time and space inseparably together. “Time, as it were'' Bakhtin writes, “thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to movements of time, plot and history” (p. 84). Bakhtin used this entangling of time and space (or, spacetime) to demonstrate how there existed many different forms of time-space configurings in literature, such as <em>adventure time, folkloric time</em>, and <em>idyllic time</em>. Spacetime, again following special relativity, is not a fixed absolute but rather is iterative and emergent. Even though Bakhtin employed the concept of chronotypes as a way to theorize literature, he did not preclude the possibility of its utility beyond the novel, especially since the very idea of chronotypes were derived from Einsteinian mathematics and had enjoyed application elsewhere in the natural sciences (Bemong &amp; Borghart, 2008). In other words, as a model for understanding the consequence of spacetime configurings, chronotypes are not just restricted to literature nor, importantly, are they simply an abstraction or literary device. Chronotypes were derived from and remain grounded in “the real;” and even more explicitly than <em>kairos</em>, chronotypes draw tightly together the emergent relationships between temporality and materiality.</p>
		
							<p>In composition-rhetoric, the concept of the chronotype has not necessarily been an area of intense disciplinary focus, but it has been employed as a framework for analyzing the relationships between: genre and power (Schryer, 1999), writers’ process and literate activity (Prior &amp; Shipka, 2003), argumentation and deliberative rhetorics (Jack, 2006), and subject-matter expertise and ontologies (Jack, 2022). Of these unquestionably important figures, Jordynn Jack stands apart given her sustained and extensive efforts to draw disciplinary attention to the rhetorical consequence of spacetime configurations. In what follows, I both draw upon and work to extend Jack’s theorization of chronotypes by arguing for the ethical valuations that accompany various spacetimes configurations, particularly those enacted in digital learning spaces. Put differently, I want to suggest that chronotypes are a matter of, per Karen Barad (2007), <em>ethico-onto-epistem-ology</em>, which denotes “an appreciation of the intertwining of ethics, knowing, and being” (p. 185). Furthermore, I want to push against the notion of multiple, competing (ethico)ontologies and instead argue for understanding chronotypes as existing in a quantum state of superposition wherein many different ethical  valuations, often contradictory, exist simultaneously in the same chronotopic spacetime configuring. </p>
							
							<p>Jack (2007) initially attended to chronotypes in largely representational terms, as “a way to understand not only how such [ideological] arguments depend on specific configurations of space and time, but also the implications of those space-time configurations for argument and decision making” (p. 52-53). More specifically, Jack uses the concept of chronotypes to analyze the ideological underpinnings of policy arguments associated with genetically modified foods (GMFs). In total, Jack identified four distinct chronotypes related to GMFs (See Table 1 below). While Jack’s work in “Chronotypes” is foundational for many reasons, I want to draw attention to two insights of particular importance. First, chronotypes not only create meaning, but they also are performative in that they coordinate action. “The relationship between space and time,” Jack argues, “is always <em>value-oriented</em>, reflecting societal assumptions about the place of human individuals in space and time and the type of action allowed within that space and time” (p. 67). Thus, chronotypes are more deliberative than they are descriptive.</p>

							<p>Second, Jack’s early work positions the technological as also material. GMFs, for Jack, are both a material thing <em>and</em> a technology. This point is key because technology, especially digital technology, is frequently read in non-material ways. For example, digital learning management systems (LMSs) are typically positioned as inert vessels through which instruction passes&mdash;as <em>non-places</em> that lack, or at best inhibit, relationships (Rice, 2012, p. 8). That is, the technological interface is often designed so as to obfuscate its presence&mdash;we are not supposed to notice the work of the interface, it is only when a “glitch” occurs that “disrupt[s] the seamlessness and intuitiveness of our electronic environments” (Boyle, 2018, p. 116) that the interface becomes perceptible or rises to the level of consciousness. Importantly, this implies that the technological is more than a backdrop for rhetoric work (Boyle et. al, 2018, p. 256). The technological is material is rhetorically consequential. Angela Haas (2012) argues just this point when she defines technology as a techné, “not as transparent things but as cultural artifacts imbued with histories and values that shape the ways in which people see themselves and others in relation to technology”(p. 288). Digital technologies, such as LMSs or GMFs, then, are not virtual spaces through which information passes devoid of relationship, they are highly consequential techno-material places&mdash;places with spacetime configurations that have the potential to control and coordinate users’ values and actions therein.</p>
