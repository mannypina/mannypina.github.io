							<p><strong>resolving indeterminacy: toward more socially just digital technologies</strong></p>
					
							<p>Thus far, I have shown how chronotopic enactments of digital learning technologies are quantum, how they exist in a state of superposition with multiple ontologies existing simultaneously in the same techno-material space. I want to conclude by discussing the importance of indeterminacy for enacting more socially just digital learning technologies. Following quantum theory, it’s important to note that these various enactments of blackboard don’t exist independent of one another; instead, superposition necessitates that they are <em>entangled</em> with/in one another. Again, one blackboard is not enough, but two is too many; blackboard is single-multiple</p>
		
							<p>But even in a state of superposition, blackboard can’t at the same time be enacted <em>both</em> as a matter of efficiency <em>and</em> social justice. Even in the quantum world this would present an intractable paradox. Barad (2007) clarifies this point using the classical Schrödinger’s cat paradox: “It is <em>not</em> the case that the cat is either alive or dead…or that the cat is both alive and dead simultaneously…or that the cat is in a state of being neither alive nor dead…the fate of the cat is entangled with the rate of the [radioactive] atom, and in the absence of an appropriate measuring apparatus, their fates are indeterminate” (p. 278). The only way to resolve the indeterminacy, again per Barad (2007), is to measure the phenomena: “When we observe a system, it ceases to be in a superposition.” It is only through the intra-action of opening the box that resolves the superposition of the cat and atom; likewise it is only by measuring blackboard&mdash;applying direct energy to understanding <em>how</em> it’s being enacted—that we can actualize it as a matter of social justice because, again, according to Katz (1992) under an ethic of expediency, efficiency quietly and quickly becomes a defacto driving force. In order to elucidate how and why indeterminacy operates in digital learning technologies, I want to turn toward one participant interview, Peyton, in particular from this research study.</p>
					
							<hr>
							
							<p>As I was interviewing Peyton, it became quickly clear that many of their enactments of blackboard, and other digital learning technologies, were underwritten by efficiency. When discussing the benefits of blackboard, Peyton noted that “what it really comes down to is efficiency and ease of use for me, the instructor. It’s wonderful for setting things up where I’m easily able to find people’s work and grade it and get it back to them in a shorter time frame.” Peyton also shared how blackboard negatively affected the efficiency of their pedagogy, saying “In person, we can have class discussions really easily. But in blackboard, you know, using the discussion board, I’m having to go through and read 150-word responses from, you know, 30 or 50 students and trying to give substantive feedback to them is just impossible.” Peyton also made multiple references to how blackboard, youtube, and zoom give students the ability to access instruction while off campus. “There’s no real substitute for live, in-person meetings,” they noted, “but at least they have the option to access that content when it’s convenient for them.” I want to be clear that in offering this extended example from Peyton’s interview I am not intending to criticize these efficiency-minded enactments of blackboard; rather, I am wanting to show that, with near ubiquity, Peyton’s enactments closely resembled <em>blackboard-as-connection</em>.</p>
				
							<p>However, as the interview drew to a close, I asked Peyton if there was anything else about their enactments of digital teaching technologies that they wanted to share with me. And something unexpected happened. Peyton shared how their child, who is hearing disabled and also enrolled at a different university, performs better in online courses, like courses delivered via zoom, because of the closed captioning capabilities that this technology offers that are not available in traditional, in-person courses. Peyton relayed specifically that online courses and supplemental instruction through youtube “creates much higher quality instruction for them [their child]. The closed captioning is really a needed thing.” Such a response was indicative of a social-justice enactment of digital learning technologies, yet Peyton was unable to see such possibilities in their own enactments of digital technology in their online classes. I don’t want to wander into conjecture about why Peyton might not have been able to see social justice potential in their own classes; rather the vitally important implication that I am driving toward is that <strong>such an enactment is only possible if purposeful and concerted energy is applied so as to resolve the indeterminacy of chronotopic superposition and make social justice a reality through digital technologies</strong>.</p>
					
							<p>Haas (2012) argues that “Technology is not just what does the work, it is the work—and that work relies on an ongoing relationship between bodies and things” (p. 291). As digital learning technologies continue to proliferate across the landscape of higher education, a trend that has only accelerated in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, it is vital for institutions and instructors to conceptualize ways for enacting these technologies, and the work they do, in ways beyond that of just efficiency. More work does need to be done that specifically examines the unique situatedness of minority students in online learning spaces; but quantum ontologies offers a productive way forward for understanding how these technologies can come to matter in more ethically defensible ways. Further, this theorization necessitates that we direct more energy, resources, and efforts toward actualizing more socially just enactments of digital technology on campuses.</p>
