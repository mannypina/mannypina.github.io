							<p><strong>blackboard-as-flexibility</strong></p>
					
							<p>Despite (or perhaps because of) their near ubiquity in online learning environments, the very mention of learning management systems (LMSs), like blackboard, tends to elicit derisive sighs and remarks about how the software’s interface is “clunky” or “not exactly the most user-friendly.” Yet, the instructional impact of LMS’s is multifaceted, as much a matter of local implementation as it is of generalized design (Boettcher, 2003; Posey &amp; Lyons, 2011), and there are a variety of ways that blackboard iterates as a techno-material space. <b>Flexibility</b> is one of the most common ways that blackboard is materially configured and instructionally enacted. For example, when queried about what they value most about blackboard, instructors most frequently cited the flexibility this technology affords students <em>and</em> instructors—where flexibility specifically refers to blackboard’s ability to distribute instruction both geographically and temporally beyond the traditional boundaries of the university. As one instructor explains:</p>
					
							<p><blockquote>“I think the first time I realized how beneficial flexibility was [in blackboard] was when I was pregnant. I was a single mother and was able to continue working…I like being able to work when I want to, and I think that need for flexibility also extends to my students. A vast majority of them [students] work, and so they’re not having to try and fit a class into their work schedule and worry about missing a class.”</blockquote></p>
		
							<p>This enactment of blackboard-as-flexibility bears resemblance to Jack’s (2006) <em>time-space compression</em> chronotype in that it reconfigures the spatiotemporal boundaries that normally mark instruction (See Table 1). Under this chronotype, the institutional reach is global—it’s presumed that teachers can teach and students can learn from anywhere (notwithstanding considerations of who actually has digital access, a point to which I return momentarily).</p>
							
							<p>Flexibility, then, becomes closely associated with efficiency and takes the form of geographic and temporal <b>connection</b>. This affirms Salisbury’s (2018) observation that many instructors see LMSs primarily as “just a tool” in service to instructional efficiency (p. 11). On the one hand, it is possible to read such a construction as operating under the auspices of an exploitive, neoliberal ethic of austerity (Welch &amp; Scott, 2016) wherein the <em>ability</em> to work flexibly can easily be co-opted by the <em>expectation</em> to do so&mdash;to be available to answer emails at all hours, to work while on family vacation, to set aside care-giving responsibilities to attend to instructional matters. As another participant described: “It [blackboard] is one of those things where it’s like 7 or 8 o’clock at night, and I’ve been up and working since literally 7 am and I’m exhausted. But I’m doing it to meet my students’ needs <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="Interestingly, this participant also noted that one of the reasons that they made themselves so openly available to students early and late into the day was their desire to improve on a specific metric from the university’s student evaluations, thereby strengthening the claim that time-space compression is underwritten by exploitive, institutional ethics.">[1]</a>.” Another participant described this phenomena as “teacher immediacy.” Another instantiation of this chronotype is the idea that online learning provides students with flexibility toward the completion of their degree and “improved time-to-graduation”, arguments made by several instructors in this study. Again, it is the techno-material configuration of blackboard itself that gives rise to this chronotopic enactment of efficiency that compresses geographic distance and elides traditional temporal boundaries associated with the university; but, this is not the only possible ontological enactment of this space-time configuring.</p>
				
							<p><strong>blackboard-as-disconnection</strong></p>
					
							<p>While blackboard is often enacted as a matter of flexibility and efficient connection across time and space, it is simultaneously decried for being a techno-material space that is both prescriptively <b>rigid</b> and <b>socially isolating</b>. As another participant expressed, “Even if you have discussion boards or public journals that have asynchronous contributions [in blackboard], it’s all still pretty rigid, pretty hierarchical. And it’s hard to have a sense of personality and to click with other people in class <a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="Important to note, and central to the argument that I am making, is that this is not the only enactment of blackboard articulated by this particular instructor. After discussing how blackboard is socially isolating, this instructor continued on to discuss how blackboard is also a matter of public health and social justice. Thus, many ontologies of this technology exist in a quantum state for this instructor. These quantum ontologies were a phenomena observed in almost every participant in this study. I return to this point more fully later in this section.">[2]</a>.” Whereas the previous enactment of <em>blackboard-as-flexibility</em> spread the university out across geographic space, this enactment draws the institution decidedly in and locates instruction in more narrow terms, as existing within the confines of a “limiting” and “rigid” software program. In fact, one participant noted that blackboard is far less flexible than their in-person teaching, and that inflexibility is highly limiting. They note,</p>
				
							<p><blockquote>“The structure of the course has to be the same week to week [in an online class] to set students up for success. Whereas when I’m teaching in-person I have more freedom…I can have a topic I want to cover but if there is something interesting happening in the world, I could incorporate that into the lecture or throw out my original lesson plan and build one on that new topic.”</blockquote></p>
		
							<p>Therefore, not only does the enactment of <em>blackboard-as-disconnection</em> constrict the material space of instruction, it also seems to fix temporality by its inability to address kairotic events in a timely fashion. Another participant echoes this same limitation, noting that “I’ll be scrolling through Facebook or AppleNews and see an article that I really think would apply well to my students, but I really have no way [in blackboard] to, you know, easily and spontaneously share this relevant and recent content with them.” Time in this ontology, then, is slowed considerably in comparison to <em>blackboard-as-connection</em> as seen when instructors describe the techno-material space as “inefficient,""cumbersome”, or “not at all user friendly.” Accordingly, the chronotopic flow of time in this space interrupts the accelerated, face-paced experience of time typically enacted in digitally-mediated environments.</p>
		
							<p>Furthermore, because this enactment of blackboard is highly disconnected, both spatially and temporally, it is also an ontology that can create social distance between users. When asked what challenges blackboard presents them, instructors frequently referenced the separation from students that is prevalent in these spaces. As one participant notes, “Teaching online, I feel like it’s hard to, I feel like I have a hard time getting to know students, getting to engage with students as people.” But more than just a matter of getting to know students on a personal level, <em>blackboard-as-disconnection</em> is also an ontology that is capable of obfuscating users' identity and cultural markers in the name of anonymity. Even if this stripping away is not intentional or a matter of purposeful design, it nevertheless has the potential to whitewash this instructional space (Banks, 2006; Kolko, 2000). For this very reason, one instructor noted that “It [blackboard] can erase a lot of students’ cultural identity…so, one of the reasons I like Slack is that it’s easier for them to create a digital presence that reflects those pieces of themselves.” Thus, as a matter of disconnection, blackboard can, in many instances, be both socially <em>and</em> culturally isolating&mdash;thereby stifling social justice efforts.</p>
