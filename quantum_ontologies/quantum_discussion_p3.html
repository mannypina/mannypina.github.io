							<p>Digital learning technologies have frequently been associated with efforts to democratize higher education (Blair &amp; Monske, 2003; Brady, 2001; Sano-Franchini, et. al., 2023). Perhaps ironically, this is an argument that can be, and often is, authorized by the <em>blackboard-as-flexibility</em> chronotype even though this spacetime configuration is underwritten by a neoliberal ideology that works counter to social justice efforts. For example, when asked how digital technologies specifically benefit minority students (again, at an institution designated as both an HSI and MSI; see study design) instructors often deferred back to the flexibility that digital technologies afford students, offering responses such as “students, if they [minority students] are experiencing hardships for whatever reason, I feel like blackboard gives them some more flexibility to deal with that and go to school” and “it [blackboard] creates opportunities toward finishing their degree that they wouldn’t have otherwise.” </p>
		
							<p>Another frequent response to the relationship between digital technologies and minority student populations was to, in well-meaning ways, sidestep the issue of culture and race altogether in favor of discussing how digital technologies affect all students. One participant noted that “It’s not just our minority students. It could be a student who perhaps works three part-time jobs to pay their bills. And so, regardless if they’re a minority student…I mean, I grew up poor too, but online learning allows them to work and still ‘come to class.’” Another participant responded similarly, saying “I don’t know if I have enough information to answer that. I don’t want to make assumptions about folks who are LGBTQIA or people of color…I have diverse classes and I haven’t seen any real differences between the way that minority student other students are affected by digital technology.” Responses such as the aforementioned indicate that social justice enactments of digital learning spaces can be rather obscure and difficult to ascertain; though this isn’t to say that such enactments are not possible, only that their realization requires acute and intentional energy applied thereto.</p>
							
							<p>In fact, even though <em>blackboard-as-social-justice</em> chronotopic enactments were a minority, there were multiple instances where instructors discussed, in pointed detail, how this digital technology works to serve issues of <b>diversity</b> and <b>justice</b> in their online classes. To begin, while many instructors did invoke <em>blackboard-as-flexibility</em>, they were equally quick to point to the tacit inequity in this chronotype by drawing attention to the persistence of the digital divide. For instance, the same instructor who previously indicated that blackboard creates opportunities for minority students immediately contextualized that comment saying,</p>
					
							<p><blockquote>“We like to think of technology as colorblind and an equalizing force, but that’s an easy assumption for a middle-aged, white person like me to make. The truth is that it does create opportunities, but those opportunities aren’t evenly distributed across demographics like income and race. Like, can I reasonably assume that my minority students have the same access to high speed internet that I do?”</blockquote></p>
				
							<p>Online instructors, in other words, are acutely aware that differential <b>access</b> impacts the social justice potential afforded by this spacetime configuring. In this chronotopic enactment, space, again, is expanded beyond the traditional boundaries of the institution. However, this expansion of space is not <em>just</em> about connection; instead it nuances the concept of connection by also considering how access is more than mere availability. Expanded access in this chronotype is a deeply networked as well as social and material phenomena inclusive of considerations like <em>quality</em> (e.g. reliable internet access, a dedicated space at home for doing school work, not having to share technology with other family members, etc.) and even types of connection across space.</p>
					
							<p>Just as the quality of access is unevenly distributed across demographics, the <b>type of connection</b> is also highly consequential for social justice enactments of this technology: desktop-blackboard is distinctly separate from mobile-blackboard. And even though students are, with increasing regularity, accessing instructional materials via their mobile devices, blackboard’s user experience is still optimized for a desktop interface. This, again, causes uneven access to instruction. As one instructor noted, “It seems like the way education is moving, students need access to something with a big enough screen that can actually do things. And a keyboard. Like, I know students are trying to submit these long blog post assignments that were written with their thumbs. You can’t write an essay with your thumbs. So, I question if those assignments are an unfair ask.” Another instructor recalled how a student had purchased a Chromebook only to discover that it wasn’t capable of doing the technological work required for the course. Thus, the <em>material</em> means of connection across wider geographic space are not, or should not be, a given; they are highly consequential. And in order to enact these technological spaces for equity and justice rather than rote efficiency, instructors must be attuned to the wider, more inclusive aspects of access.</p>
				
							<p>Another important spatial aspect of the <em>blackboard-as-social-justice</em> chronotype is that precisely because this technology broadens the traditional geographic reach of the institution, it creates instructional spaces that are more <b>culturally responsive</b> and, in many cases, more welcoming for minority students. As one participant explained, “When students go into a physical space on campus, they know very quickly what the dominant cultural narrative is there—it’s a white space. Whereas, in an online learning environment, you don’t have those traditional white-dominant optics…we can create a space that is free from hegemonic optics.” Again, contra <em>blackboard-as-flexibility</em>, in this enactment of blackboard, it's not that instruction can be <em>anywhere</em>, a spacetimemattering that is underwritten by neoliberal ethics; instead, the specific locations—technologically, materially, and culturally—matter, particularly for minority students. An example of how the specificity of space matter was indicated by a participant who noted that “One characteristic of our student population [as an HSI] is that, and this is anecdotal but it’s a fair point, but I’ve seen in my students a strong connection to place and family. So, online tech allows students the opportunity to stay connected to the cultural places that matter to them while still going to school.” In this instance, blackboard is still a matter of connection, but that connection comes to matter through social justice concerns rather than simply being able to access the institution anywhere and anytime. </p>
